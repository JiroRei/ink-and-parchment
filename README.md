Give ID or die. I don't want to use Discord anymore as it now requires you to submit IDs and facial scans. That's why I'm trying to make my own messaging platform for my friends and I. Hopefully I get enough money to be able to host a multitude of users in the future. 
You know what? Fuck this era of the internet. An era where the government forces you to submit your whole identity to be used on the Palantir project of theirs. Humam Sakhnini, fuck you in particular you Israeli piece of shit. Honestly, I'm just trying to get out of discord now that it's owned by the fucking 🧃.
